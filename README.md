# R-parser
read in a directory, go thru .xlsx files and each tab within them, parse them according to preset criteria. 
This parser is originally used to parse a limited amount of daily KPI spreadsheets. 
The parser is able to fetch the date in the file name and meet specific criteria, which is mosaiced in this sample for NDA reasons.
